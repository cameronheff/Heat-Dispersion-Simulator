NOTES: Does Halo cells mean an outer-lining surrounding the array with values of
zero that essentially drain some of the heat (value) from neighboring cells, but
doesn't hold that heat? As in, drains some of the heat, but is still set at zero always
I believe it means there is the extra outerlining, and only the column to the leftmost
in this outerlining is set to starting temp PERMANENTLY, not the actual cells inside
the actual 2D array being plotted

Temperature Formula
temp[i,j]= 1/4(oldTemp[i−1,j]+oldTemp[i+1,j]+oldTemp[i,j−1]+oldTemp[i,j+1])
